# Assignment
Terraform assignment
I have included the variables such as prefix, AWS region, cidr block etc values in the terraform.tfvars file.
If any of these values need to be changed, this can be done from the terraform.tfvars file.
# Steps for deployment
Login to an AWS account where the resources will be created
1. Terraform init
2. Terraform plan
3. Terraform apply

The plan output can be found in the terraform plan output.txt file.
